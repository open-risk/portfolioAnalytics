Examples of visualizing thresholds
================================================

The examples directory includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to help you get started

- Generating loss distributions analytically
- Estimating thresholds given a multi-period transition matrix set

Located in examples/python (For testing purposes all examples can be run using the run_examples.py script
located in the root directory)
